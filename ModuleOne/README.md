# Overview

I am trying to become the best software engineer that I can be, and I can't do that by skipping ahead or going to fast. 
I become the best by mastering the basics in a new language for me! I learned C++, C#, Javascript, HTML, R, and a bit of SQL so far. Kotlin is my newest language.

I wrote a lot of short snippets of code to demostrate variables, conditions, expressions, functions, loops, and classes.

To learn the basics of Kotlin and possibly use it later for my team's project.

# Development Environment

I used a new programming environment called IntelliJ IDEA CE, I could of used visual studios if I got the right
extentions and packages, but I want to try something new. Both are great tools.

Just Kotlin
