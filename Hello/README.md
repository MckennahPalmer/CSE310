# Overview

I am trying to become the best software engineer that I can be, and I can't do that by skipping ahead or going to fast. 
I become the best by mastering the basics, hence a classic Hello World program, but in a new language for me! I learned C++, C#, Javascript, HTML, R, and a bit of SQL so far.

You get a message that greets the world. * I was tempted to change the message to Hello Universe! to greet everything. *

I wrote the program to help me practice and master the basics.

Here is a link to a video demonstrating a run of the code:

# Development Environment

I used git to push to github to store it, and I wrote the program in Visual Studios.

I used python as the code, so I can start learning it. I have heard it is very easy to use.
